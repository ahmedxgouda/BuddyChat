## Overview

This is the API documentation for the BuddyChat API. The API is built with Django and GraphQL using graphene. The API introduces a chat system with the following features:

- User registration and authentication
- Chat system
- Group chat system
- Notifications
- Real-time chat messages
- Copy of messages for each user which leads to the ability to delete messages for each user

## Subscriptions

### Approach

- The API uses `Django Channels` with `signals` to send messages to the client. The messages which are sent are not much like `GraphQL` subscriptions. They are more like `WebSocket` messages. Because of `Graphene` limitations, I made a workaround to send messages like `WebSocket` messages. The subprotocol used is `graphql-transport-ws`.
- The subscription is done by sending a `subscription` query to the API with the following structure:

    ```graphql
    subscription {
        subscribe {
            success
        }
    }
    ```

- This query is done to subscribe to the messages. The `success` field returns `True` and it is not used. The subscription is done by sending a `next` message to the client with the message payload.

### Message Structure

- All messages are sent as `next` messages and contain the field `id` which represents the subscription id.
- The message contains `payload` which contains the actual message.
- The `payload` message is an object with the following properties:
  - `type`: The type of the message. It is always `broadcast`.
  - `operation`: The operation which is done.
  - `payload`: The actual payload of the message.

## Other Features

### Throttling

To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the BuddyChat API implements throttling. This limits the number of requests a user can make to the API within a certain time frame. If the limit is exceeded, the API will return a `403` error response.

### Pagination

The BuddyChat API supports pagination for queries that return lists of items. This helps to manage large datasets by breaking them into smaller, more manageable chunks. Pagination is implemented using the `first` and `after` arguments for forward pagination, and `last` and `before` arguments for backward pagination. The API returns a `PageInfo` object that includes information about the current page and whether there are more pages available.

### Filtering

To provide more flexibility in querying data, the BuddyChat API supports filtering on various fields. Filters can be applied to queries to narrow down the results based on specific criteria. The available filters are documented for each query type.

## Conclusion

The BuddyChat API provides a comprehensive set of features for building a robust chat application. With support for user authentication, real-time messaging, group chats, notifications, and more, it offers a solid foundation for any chat-based application. The API is designed to be flexible and scalable, with features like throttling, pagination, and filtering to handle various use cases and ensure optimal performance. Whether you're building a simple chat app or a complex messaging platform, the BuddyChat API has you covered.
